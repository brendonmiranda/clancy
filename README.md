<!-- <img src="" alt="clancy" align="right" height="500px"> -->
<p> Clancy is a discord music bot made in Spring Boot and Java. It has been mainly built to provide a nice music bot for my friends, and you can use it to provide for yours as well. </p>

<p> If you are interested in either set it up to run yourself or explore the code to understand how to build your own bot, this is a pretty nice project to follow. </p>

<p> Clancy is built on java 11, however it should work on java 8+. </p>

<p> This project is possible because of LavaPlayer, JDA-Utilities, JDA and specially jagrosh. </p>
