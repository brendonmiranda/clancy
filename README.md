<!-- <img src="https://i.imgur.com/hugrvCl.png" alt="clancy" align="right" height="320px"> -->
<p> Clancy is a Discord music bot made in Spring Boot and Java. It has been mainly built to provide a nice music bot for my friends, and you can use it to provide for yours as well. </p>

<p> If you are interested in either set it up to run yourself or explore the code to understand how to build your own bot, this is a pretty nice project to follow. </p>

<p> Clancy is built on java 11. </p>
